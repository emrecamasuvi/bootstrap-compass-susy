# Bootstrap Compass Susy
______
This package consist of neither all-in-one package nor build tool.
This only includes the core files and these are:
- 2 Custom Fonts (fontawesome and pt sans)
- Up-to-date JS files
- Up-to-date bootstrap style files; forked from thomas-mcdonald's sass repo
 - These sass files are refactored to be compatible with compass framework
 - And also bootstrap's native grid is too restrictive so i removed those code and integrated susy compatible sass code
 Cheers.
